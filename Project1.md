## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>

## Loading the data

When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:

* The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. 

* The data used in this assignment is from the dates 2007-02-01 and
2007-02-02. 

* Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as `?`.


## Making Plots

The overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is to
reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed
using the base plotting system.

Fork and clone the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)


Each plot should:

* Be constructed and saved to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Named the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Created a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. 

Note: the code file **should include code for reading
the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. Also, the code should include the code that creates the PNG file.

## Solution:

In this repository there are:

* Four R scripts corresponding to `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, and `plot4.R`.
* Four plots generated using the above R scripts respectively. 

The four plots are:

### Plot 1


![plot1](plot1.png) 


### Plot 2

![plot2](plot2.png) 


### Plot 3

![plot3](plot3.png) 


### Plot 4

![plot4](plot4.png)
